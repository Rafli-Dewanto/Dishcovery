          <p className="mb-3">
            At Dishcovery, safeguarding your data is a top priority. We take
            data security seriously and have implemented various measures to
            ensure that your information remains secure. Here's a more detailed
            look at our data security practices:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold">Encryption</p>
          <ul className="mb-3 ml-4 list-disc">
            <li>
              Data Transmission: When you interact with Dishcovery, data is
              encrypted during transmission to and from our servers. We use
              secure, encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) to protect your data as it
              travels over the internet. This encryption ensures that your
              information remains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized
              parties during transit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data Storage: Your personal information and user-generated content
              are stored in secure, encrypted databases. This encryption
              prevents unauthorized access to your data even if there is a
              breach of our physical or digital storage systems.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold">Access Control</p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Authorized Access: Access to your data is strictly limited to
            authorized personnel who require it to perform their duties. We
            follow strict access control protocols to ensure that only the
            necessary individuals can access and manage user data.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold">Regular Security Audits</p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Ongoing Evaluations: We conduct regular security audits and
            assessments to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats to
            your data. Our team continuously monitors our systems and
            infrastructure to ensure that they remain secure.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold">Security Training</p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Employee Training: Our employees receive training in security best
            practices and data handling. This includes awareness of social
            engineering threats, phishing attacks, and other common security
            risks to ensure that they can recognize and respond to potential
            threats.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold"> Secure Account Management</p>
          <ul className="mb-3 ml-4 list-disc">
            <li>
              Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed and salted to
              protect them from unauthorized access. This means that even our
              own employees cannot view your password
            </li>
            <li>
              Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): We offer two-factor
              authentication as an additional layer of security for your
              account. Enabling 2FA provides an extra level of protection by
              requiring a second verification step when logging in.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold">Data Breach Response</p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Incident Response: In the event of a data breach or security
            incident, we have established procedures in place to respond swiftly
            and appropriately. We will notify affected users and take necessary
            steps to mitigate any potential harm.

          <p className="mb-3 font-bold">User Responsibility</p>
          <p>
            Account Security: It's important to note that while we implement
            stringent security measures, the security of your account
            credentials is your responsibility. We recommend maintaining strong,
            unique passwords and not sharing them with others.
